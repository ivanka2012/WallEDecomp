# HID Utilities

This is Apple's HID_Utilities sample code by George Warner and available from his personal website  (perhaps at somewhere else too) from around 2006-2007. Note that his version is not something I could find anywhere besides from Second Life's libndofdev and [this](https://dev.sabi.net/trac/dev/browser/trunk/StreamVision/HID_Utilities_External.h?rev=518&desc=1).

I've looked far and wide and came up empty for the specific version WALL-E has. Unfortunately George Warner has passed away in 2024 so there's zero chance of asking him for the original source code.

I'll have to ask Asobo for this one.
