# HID Utilities

This is Apple's HID_Utilities sample code by George Warner, available from his [personal website](http://homepage.mac.com/geowar1) (most likely at somewhere else too) and accessed around late 2006. Not much to say except that I had to go above and beyond to find this. 

Very special thanks to ArchiveTeam for archiving Apple MobileMe back in 2012. **You guys rock**!!!
